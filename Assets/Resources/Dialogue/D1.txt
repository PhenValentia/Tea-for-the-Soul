[e][Lapis]This teapot goes over here in this cupboard…
[e][Lapis]...And that’s all! Nothing else left in the boxes to unpack.
[e][Lapis]Finally! After all of that work, I’ve finally finished moving over!
[e][Lapis]All of those years training to become a fortune teller…
[e][Lapis]They’re finally paying off!
[e][Lapis]I’m gonna have my own “business!
[e][Lapis]Aaaaaah! I’m so happy!
[e][Lapis]And I’ve got a lovely town assigned to me!
[e][Lapis]And it has such a perfect forest too!
[e][Lapis]I only took a glance at it yesterday and it has everything I could hope for!
[e][Lapis]Lots of magic ingredients. It’s perfect!
[e][Lapis]...
[e][Lapis]I hope the spell I casted last night takes effect…
[e][Lapis]Sometimes it’s hard to know what people are going through.
[e][Lapis]But my spell will help me out in my task naturally.
[e][Lapis]I can already feel that I’m gonna help so many people.
[e][Lapis]I can’t wait!
[Knock][Lapis]Oh! Seems like someone else can’t wait as well.
[DoorOpen][Lapis][1]Come in!
