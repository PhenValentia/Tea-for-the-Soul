[e][Antoine]Good morning miss! Came here to congratulate ya for moving over!
[e][Lapis]Thank you! That’s lovely of you!
[e][Lapis]My name is Lapis. It’s a pleasure to meet you
[e][Antoine]The name’s Antoine, nice to meet ya too.
[e][Antoine]I’ve been living here for as long as I can remember
[e][Antoine]So I have an 'AnTON' of things to show you over if you want to.
[Laugh][Antoine]Hahahahahahahaha!
[Laugh][Lapis]Haha! Thanks for the offer! You’re very kind.
[e][Antoine]Oh, no problem at all. Happy to help newcomers.
[e][Lapis]If you like helping, I guess that’s one thing we have in common, hahaha!
[Question][Antoine]Oh, what do you work for?
[e][Lapis]Oh, let’s just say that I’m great at helping people over tea.
[Question][Antoine]Oh, a psychologist?
[e][Lapis]...More or less.
[e][Lapis]But I deal with more… esoteric methods
[Question][Antoine]Oh, like what?
[e][Lapis]Oh, just the arcane and nature
[Laugh][Antoine]Oh! Didn’t know you would deal with that kinda stuff
[e][Antoine]I guess that maybe if you specialize in this kinda stuff you can help me out
[e][Antoine]Because I just found this morning these weird looking cards at home
[e][Antoine]And I for sure didn’t pick them up
[Idea][Lapis]Oh!
[e][Antoine]Oh, you know?
[Thinking][Lapis]Tarot cards!
[e][Lapis]Those are the ones for The Hermit, Star and Strength
[e][Lapis]My spell took effect!
[e][Lapis]Yes, I think I know!
[e][Antoine]Really? Oh, gee, that’s a relief
[e][Lapis]However, Antoine, right now I’m a bit busy
[e][Antoine]Makes sense. With you moving over… your schedule must be packed!
[Laughing][Antoine]Hahahaha!
[Laughing][Lapis]Haha! If you want to, we can meet later over some tea to talk about it.
[e][Antoine]Oh, I wouldn’t want to monopolize more of your time.
[e][Lapis]Don’t worry at all! It’s my pleasure!
[e][Antoine]Well, these are just some weird cards
[e][Lapis]Not at all! Let show you over tea. Please.
[e][Antoine]... If you insist.
[e][Lapis]Perfect! Would you want to meet in like… two hours?
[e][Antoine]Fine for me. I live not very far from here, at the end of the road.
[e][Lapis]Lovely! See ya then!
[e][Antoine]Tea you soon!
[Laughing][Antoine]Hahahahaha!
[DoorClose][Lapis][4]Bye!
[e][Lapis]My spell took effect.
[e][Lapis]Tarot cards must have been appearing all over town.
[e][Lapis]Those with cards must have some issues they need help with.
[e][Lapis]They probably don’t want to show it, like here with Antoine.
[e][Lapis]But I’m sure that my tea and my magical abilities can help them out.
[e][Lapis]I just need to find some ingredients.
[e][Lapis]The nearby forest must have everything.
[e][Lapis][6]Let’s go out!
