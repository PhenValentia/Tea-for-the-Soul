[e][Lapis]Ah! So great to have some fresh air!
[e][Lapis]Hmmm… In any case, I need to go to the forest on my right.
[e][Lapis]Seeing how the cards Antoine had were the hermit, the star and strength…
[e][Lapis]I’m gonna need to pick up…
[e][Lapis]A "Lone Lamp", a plant with open purple flowers and closed red ones…
[e][Lapis]A "Nebulasprout", a plant with a thick stem and many purple and white flowers…
[e][Lapis]And a "Valiantsoul", a plant with a spiny stem and many red flowers together.
[e][Lapis]Hmmm… Yeah, that seems right
[e][Lapis]Let’s goooo!
